What is Version Control?
Version control lets you track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and revert mistakes. It's essential in software projects to:

Avoid code loss.

Collaborate across teams.

Reproduce exact versions for debugging.

Introduction to Git
Git is a distributed version control system. Instead of tracking file changes line-by-line like older systems, Git takes snapshots of your entire project.

Key Concepts:

Repository: Your project and its history.

Commit: A snapshot with a message describing the changes.

Branch: A separate line of development.

Merge: Combining changes from branches.

Introduction to GitHub
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories. It allows you to:

Backup your code online.

Collaborate with others.

Review code and manage issues.

Introduction to GitHub Desktop
GitHub Desktop is a user-friendly GUI for Git. It allows you to:

Visualize changes and history.

Easily stage, commit, and push changes.

Work with branches and pull requests.

Setting Up GitHub Desktop
Download from: https://desktop.github.com/

Install and open GitHub Desktop.

Sign in with your GitHub account.

Creating a Repository
Option 1: Create a new local repo
Open GitHub Desktop â†’ File â†’ New Repository

Name it, choose a path, and click Create Repository.

Option 2: Clone an existing remote repo
In GitHub Desktop â†’ File â†’ Clone Repository

Select from GitHub or paste a repo URL.

Git Workflow with GitHub Desktop (Using This Project)
1. Making Changes
Edit any file (e.g., main.py or README.md) in your code editor.

2. Staging Changes
GitHub Desktop shows all modified files. Select the ones you want to include.

3. Committing Changes
Write a clear commit message, like Added FastAPI root endpoint, and click Commit to main.

4. Pushing Changes
Click Push origin to upload your commits to GitHub.

5. Pulling Changes
Click Fetch origin â†’ Pull to sync with any changes made remotely.

Branching and Merging
Why Branch?
Branching lets you work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

Common branch names:
feature/file-upload

bugfix/input-validation

GitHub Desktop makes it easy:
Create: Branch â†’ New Branch

Switch: Click current branch â†’ Select another

Merge: Click Branch â†’ Merge into current branch

Understanding Pull Requests (PRs)
A Pull Request proposes changes from one branch to another (usually into main).

Steps:
Push your feature branch to GitHub.

On GitHub, click Compare & Pull Request.

Review changes, add comments if needed.

After review, click Merge Pull Request.

Stashing Changes (Optional)
If you need to switch tasks:

Use GitHub Desktop to stash uncommitted changes.

Later, reapply the stash to continue.

Resolving Merge Conflicts
Merge conflicts happen when changes clash.

In GitHub Desktop:
It shows conflicting files.

Open in editor â†’ manually fix â†’ mark as resolved.

Commit the resolution.

Using .gitignore
Avoid committing unnecessary files by adding them to .gitignore.

Recommended entries for FastAPI:
markdown
Copy
Edit
__pycache__/
.env
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.sqlite3
venv/
.env.*
Best Git Practices
Commit often with meaningful messages.

Use branches for new features.

Make small, focused pull requests.

Sync frequently using pull.

Use GitHub Issues to track bugs and features.

Setting Up and Running the Project
1. Clone the repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-fastapi-repo.git
cd your-fastapi-repo
2. Create a virtual environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
3. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the FastAPI server
bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
5. Open in browser:
Swagger Docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

requirements.txt
Hereâ€™s what your requirements.txt should include:

nginx
Copy
Edit
fastapi
uvicorn
pydantic
python-multipart
(You can run pip freeze > requirements.txt to update it later.)

Final Words
This project is a simple but powerful example of using FastAPI with full Git and GitHub workflow, perfect for learning how to manage both code and collaboration effectively.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
